This was the second project done for Stat 6021 at the University of Virginia School of Data Science with the team members: Stephen Morris, Siddharth Surapeneni, Michael Kolonay, and Jordan Machita. The purpose of this project was to create models to predict the quality rating of wine based on given characteristics. The data is split into two separate datasets, one for red wines and the other for whites, and the models were built separately for each color.
